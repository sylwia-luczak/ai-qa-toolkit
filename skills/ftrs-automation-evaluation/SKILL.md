# FTRS — Step 5: Integration / Automation Test Evaluation

## When to Use

Invoke after `ftrs-manual-test-plan`. This is Step 5 of the full FTRS test workflow.

---

## Procedure

Evaluate whether integration or automated tests should be added for this ticket.

### Evaluation Criteria

Answer each of the following explicitly:

| Factor | Question |
|---|---|
| Cross-service impact | Does this change affect multiple services? |
| API Gateway | Are API routes or gateway config affected? |
| Lambda behaviour | Is Lambda logic changed? |
| Database side effects | Are DynamoDB writes/reads affected? |
| Feature flags | Is behaviour gated behind a flag? |
| Caching behaviour | Could cached values cause stale behaviour? |
| Authentication / authorisation | Are auth rules changed? |
| Logging validation | Should CloudWatch output be validated? |
| Environment-based config | Does behaviour differ across environments? |

---

## If Automation Is Justified

Propose:
- **Test scope** — what is being tested end-to-end
- **Test structure** — file/folder layout
- **Mocking strategy** — what is mocked vs real
- **Environment strategy** — which environment, test data approach
- **CI impact** — will new tests affect pipeline duration or stability?

---

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **UI testing**: Playwright
- **Test format**: Gherkin (BDD)
- **Infrastructure**: AWS — DynamoDB, Athena, Lambda, CloudWatch, SQS
- **Database access**: DBeaver and SQL (Old DOS)

---

## Naming Convention for Test Data (OldDOS Services)

- **GP Practice IDs**: `9XXXX0Y` — where `XXXX` = ticket number, `Y` = scenario number
- **Pharmacy IDs**: `8XXXX0Y` — where `XXXX` = ticket number, `Y` = scenario number
- Names should be natural — avoid ticket numbers in names and excessive use of "TEST"

---

## Example Automation Scenario

**Tags:** `@data-migration`
**Feature:** Data Migration

```gherkin
Background:
  Given the test environment is configured
  And the DoS database has test data
  And DynamoDB tables are ready

Scenario: Happy path migration for a GP Practice
  Given a "Service" exists in DoS with attributes
    | key        | value                     |
    | id         | 10005752                  |
    | uid        | 138179                    |
    | name       | Abbey Medical Practice    |
    | odscode    | M81094                    |
    | typeid     | 100                       |
    | statusid   | 1                         |

  When the data migration process is run for table 'services', ID '10005752' and method 'insert'

  Then the SQS event metrics should be:
    - 1 total, 1 supported, 0 unsupported
    - 1 transformed, 1 inserted, 0 updated
    - 0 skipped, 0 errors

  And there is 1 organisation, 1 location and 1 healthcare service created
  And the state table contains a record for key 'services#10005752' with version 1
```

## If Automation Is NOT Justified

State clearly why automation is not warranted and confirm that manual testing is sufficient.
